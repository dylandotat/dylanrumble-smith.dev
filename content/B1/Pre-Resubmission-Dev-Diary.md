# Introduction
Before the B1 submission started, I barely had any Dev Diary work in my original submission. The only dev diary I had was the commits I had in my repository, which as I found out when I got my B1 grades back, is not sufficient for any decent or good grades. This is a **major** problem, as I am trying to aim for good grades so I can get into university. This document is a recollection of what happened during this time from a mixture of:
- File Metadata
- GitHub Commits
- My *poor* memory

This will not be 100% accurate, but since I don’t have a dev diary for this period of time, *something is better than nothing right?*
