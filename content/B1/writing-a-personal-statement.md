As the end of the UCAS application window is quickly approaching, I had to make sure that all my UCAS questions have been done. So, I spent the evening getting them all done.

This took me a while as one of the hardest things for me was getting it so sound professional and trying to remove fluff from  the sentences, something that I do quite often.

In the end, I managed to get all the questions done and written.
