Yesterday and the day before that, I was researching different jobs and inspirational people that I could find in those job roles.

My goal was to have something about Jobs in my research, because on that front it was a bit void of information. And though I think I still need to do more, I am a bit more happy with what I have got.

In my research I looked at the following jobs:

- Software Engineering
- DevOps
- Data Science
- Cyber Security Analyst

And I looked at the following people in DevOps:

- Dave Farley
- Jez Humble
- Richard Towers

Most of my sources came from either personal websites or LinkedIn. Doing research about these people was hard because there was not much publicly available research about them. I have been going at a fine pace in terms of getting everything done in time on my Monday.com board.

My confidence that I will get a good grade in my B1 Resubmission has gone down a lot. I did not do well in B1. I don’t think I am going to do well in B1 Resubmission.
